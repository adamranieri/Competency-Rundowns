# Test General
Adam Ranieri

### Defintion
General Testing is the ability to think critically about creating test cases, knowledge of testing workflows, and understanding of terminology used in testing. General testing is independent of any programming language. All the general testing exercises can be done without coding. The competency is geared towards roles in Quality Assurance and SDET. 

### Abilities
-	Create test cases for features 
-	Know how to create and fill out documents related to testing
    -	Requirements Traceability Matrix
    -	Defect Report
-	Know how to read and purpose of a 
    -	Test Plan 
    -	Test Strategy
-	Complete understanding of the STLC
-   Complete understanding of the Defect Lifecycle
-	Test reporting
-	Definition level understanding of many types of testing
    -	Should be able to connect them to each other 
    -	Should be able to explain the purpose of the testing
    -	NOT expected to be able to perform each type of testing

### Trainer Advice
-	Clients place a heavy emphasis on knowing the STLC, Testing Terminology and Test Reporting.
    -	Using software tools like Jira to report test cases is very helpful
    -	A lot of test reporting software is proprietary however
-	A single test is often of many types. Associates sometimes feel like a test is 1 specific thing.
    -	A script that calls a URL endpoint to see if it works correctly with correct inputs is an Automated, black-box, system, functional, positive test 
-	Many types of testing require a solid understanding of full stack architecture and how code connects to each other.
    -	Many types of testing will not make sense without at least some background
        -	API Testing for example
-	Testing is a very expansive field. Literally any type of software can have testing associated with it. 
    -	Try to focus on theory and terms outside of a specific technology
-	The terms and lifecycles used in testing often lack official definition
    -	Many versions of the STLC or multiple definitions for a type of testing
    - Testing document structure being different for every company and project

## Assessment

### Green Flags
-	Associate can completely explain the STLC and Defect Lifecycle. 
    -	The Steps
    -	The documents associated with each step
-	Associate can create a requirements matrix with accompanying test cases without any assistance.
-	If asked a testing term can explain
    -	What it is 
    -	Why it is important
    -	What it does not test
    -	How it relates to other test types
    -	An example of that test (not coded just verbally explained)

### Red Flags
- Associate cannot walk through STLC or Defect Lifecycles
- Fails to understand basic testing terms like
  - Postive and Negative testing
  - Functional and non functional testing
  - Automated vs manual testing
  - unit, integeration and system tests
- Associate is unable to describe the purpose or parts of a RTM, Test Plan or Test Strategy
