### Definition
Coding Challenges is the ability to solve interview style coding assessments and questions. The questions/assessments are generally less than 1 hour. These questions are self contained are usually have specific inputs with desired outputs. It is not general software capability such as writing a full stack application or literacy like knowing file dirctories and setting environment variables. [Common questions](https://revature0.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/trainers/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB10AEE96-3FF4-4958-87C5-7F2D90BD7C5D%7D&file=Common%20Programming%20Questions.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&isSPOFile=1&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMjEwMjgwNzIwMCIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D&cid=291d229e-cfbf-4339-9dc5-1a1b91153c47)

### Abilities
- Look at a plain English coding challenge question and break it into programming terms.
- Utilize control flow
  - For loops
  - While loops
  - conditionals
  - Switch statements
- Can create helper functions to assist in solving coding challenges
- Utilize various data structures like arrays and dictionaries
- Can do various types of string manipulation
  - Reverse
  - Find pattern
  - anagram
  - palindrome
  - number of occurences

### Trainer Advice
- Repetition is vital in keeping associates progressing in their coding ability
  - Small daily coding challenge
  - Weekly larger coding challenges
- Encourage exercises where people of the same level of ability work together.
  - Prevent weaker associates from being intimiated
  - Allows stronger associates to learn from each other
- Associates can lose confidence if not given 'wins' from successfully finishing challenges

## Assessment 

### Green Flags
- Coding challenges are solved in ways not explcitly taught
- Usage of techniques that were learned in training
  - Usages of lambdas in a filter
- Ability to solve questions in pseudo code or even multiple languages
- Completed many of the most common coding challenges
  - Fibonacci
  - implement a Java Collection 
  - fizz buzz
  - write code to check for duplicate values in a string

### Red Flags
- Has not improved in ability from the first day
- Simple challenges like find the highest number in an array are too difficult after a few weeks
- scores 0 on coding challenges with nothing to show for it
- says things like "I don't know where to start"
